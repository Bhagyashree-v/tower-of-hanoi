move disks from tower 1 to tower 2 using tower 3 snd tower 4 as temporary towers.
tower 1=source tower
tower 2=destination tower
tower 3 and tower 4=temporary towers
NOTE=by using 4 towers decreases time complexity.
example:
let us consider N =4 discs and 4 towers/pegs/rods as A,B,C,D
FOR 4 TOWERS AND 4 DISCS WE CAN MOVE THE DISCS FROM TOWER1 TO TOWER 2 IN 9 MOVES BY USING TEMPORARY TOWERS.
(we team of 3 have done tis code using c language.and we faced lots of eerors while creating this program.)
INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN THE CODE:
in the code just give the any value for N.
it will get the output of transferring the discs from tower 1 to tower 2 by using tower 3 and tower 4 as temporary towers.
